# Pong game (Functional Reactive Programming)
This is an individual academic project for the course Programming Paradigms. It is a simple pong game with the application of Functional Reactive Programming techniques. This game is implemented in TypeScript and use RxJS Observable streams to handle animation and user interaction. I mostly worked on pong.ts which is the source code for this pong game, and modified pong.html for the basic structure and layout of the game. Starter code is provided by Professor Tim Dwyer.
